Directions to execute:
 
Run each algorithm by running each file separately from the file names given above. Each file reads from a file called “suduko.txt” which should contain the initial state for the board. For instance, the inputFile.txt contains the state given below from the question. In order to test for different levels(medium/hard/evil), change the state in the suduko.txt. There is an existing file called suduko.txt present in the git repository.
